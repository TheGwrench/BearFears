### Process Path

## Current steps
Phase 1: Requirements & Safety Analysis (2-4 weeks)
    Document Requirements
        Use free or affordable tools like Visure Requirements ALM (offers trial) or even structured Excel/Word templates
        Perform Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment (HARA) to determine ASIL level based on Severity, Exposure, and Controllability
    Target ASIL B or C maximum for single-engineer feasibility (ASIL D requires extensive organizational infrastructure)
Safety Concept
    Define safety goals and derive safety requirements allocated to architectural components
        Consider ASIL decomposition to reduce requirements where possible
